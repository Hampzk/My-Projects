# My-Projects
In this project, I demonstrated essential data-cleaning techniques in Excel, ensuring a structured and accurate dataset for analysis. The process involved trimming unnecessary spaces, removing unwanted characters, standardizing names, and applying IF-ELSE logic to handle missing or incorrect values. Additionally, I removed duplicate entries to maintain data integrity.

To transform the cleaned dataset into meaningful insights, I utilized pivot tables to organize data efficiently. I then created dynamic charts to visualize trends, patterns, and key metrics, making the information easier to interpret.

This project highlights my ability to clean and analyze raw data effectively, ensuring accuracy while enhancing visualization for better decision-making.
